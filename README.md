**Deep Reinforcement Learning for Optimal Trade Execution**

This project implements a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) agent to learn optimal execution strategies for large stock orders using reinforcement learning. The environment is based on the Almgrenâ€“Chriss model and is extended with advanced market dynamics such as stochastic volatility (Heston), jumps (Merton), and trading fees.
